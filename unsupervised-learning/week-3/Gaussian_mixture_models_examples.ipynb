    "In this train, we introduce an example of a **soft clustering** technique. Recall that soft clustering techniques are techniques where data points can belong to multiple clusters to varying degrees. Unlike hard clustering techniques, soft clustering techniques are better suited for cases where clusters overlap with each other. This is because soft clustering techniques keep all possibilities of cluster assignment. Let's see if we can explain this point better by using an example. Remember this dress?\n",

    "[This dress](https://www.dictionary.com/e/s/trippy-favorite-viral-optical-illusions-explained/#the-dress-black-and-blue-or-white-and-gold) sparked an internet-wide debate because some people perceived it as black and blue, and some perceived it as white and gold. A hard clustering algorithm like K-means would have to pick a side in this debate. However, a soft clustering algorithm would pick both sides. In this case, if 39% of the people in this debate classified the dress as black and blue while 61% classified it as white and gold, then a soft-clustering algorithm would classify the dress as **39% black and blue, and 61% white and gold**. Another way to explain this clustering paradigm is by explaining the cluster membership of any given data point using a categorical distribution over all cluster labels. If we are forced to make a decision on that data point, then we sample a cluster label from our categorical distribution and use that as the correct answer. In this case, if we are asked about the dress lots of times, 61% of the time, we'll say it's white and gold, and 39% of the time, we'll say it's black and blue. \n",

    "Before we go on to discuss how the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm (i.e., the algorithm for training GMMs) works, we need to first talk about what it means to fit a Gaussian distribution to some data. Fitting a Gaussian distribution to a dataset means that we assume that the data was generated in a Gaussian way, i.e., the data is normally distributed and was generated using some **mean** and some **variance**. Of course, this assumption is not always true, but it is a relatively safe assumption to make since a lot of processes in the real world are Gaussian-distributed.
